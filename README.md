# Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Attention

## Overview
This project implements an LSTM with Attention mechanism
for complex multi-seasonal time series forecasting.

## Features
- Synthetic dataset (6000 time steps)
- Baseline LSTM
- LSTM + Attention
- RMSE, MAE, MAPE evaluation
- Attention interpretation

## Result
Attention model improved RMSE over baseline.
